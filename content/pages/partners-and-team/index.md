### Related projects

The Calliope team also leads these related projects, which we often use to generate input data for Calliope-based models:

* [Renewables.ninja](https://www.renewables.ninja/) generates time series of solar and wind power generation as well as of space heating and cooling demand globally, using carefully validated and bias-corrected simulation models
* [RAMP](https://rampdemand.org/) is a software suite for the stochastic simulation of user-driven energy demand time series, for example, domestic hot water or electric vehicle charging demand.
