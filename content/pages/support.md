### Quick start

* **Installing** is easiest with the Conda package manager by running a single command on any of Windows, macOS or Linux: ``conda create -c conda-forge -n calliope calliope``. See the documentation for more [information on installing](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/installation.html).
* **Simple examples** are included with Calliope; the [tutorials in the documentation](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/tutorials.html) run through these examples.
* A **good place to start** is to look at [the tutorials]([https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/tutorials.html) to get a feel for how Calliope works, and then to read the "[Introduction](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/introduction.html)", "[Building a model](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/building.html)", "[Running a model](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/running.html)", and "[Analysing a model](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/analysing.html)" sections in the online documentation.
* Finally, looking at **more fully-featured models** used in real studies is a good basis to get started with your own projects â€” browse the [research page](/research) for a range of information on work with Calliope, much of which uses freely available models that you can take as a starting point for your own project.
